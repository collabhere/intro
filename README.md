# The Community

Welcome to the community! We are a group of software engineers who work in various domains. We mostly collaborate on a wide array of projects under the community's handle but are open to researching and contirbuting to existing FOSS projects out in the wild.

# Contributing

All projects in the community generally follow the same contributing guidelines, which can be found [here](./CONTRIBUTING.md). For project specific guidelines, you will find a CONTRIBUTING.md outlining specifics within the project repository. 

# Code of Conduct

To help create a positive social atmosphere, a code of conduct must be adhered to. This can be read [here](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
