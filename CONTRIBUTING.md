# Contributing

Thanks for considering contributing to our community projects. 

Following these guidelines helps communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing in our open source projects. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests. 

Here's a few general guidelines that pertain to all forms of contributions:

* Search for existing Issues or Pull Requests before creating your own.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Issues: Reporting Bugs & Suggesting Enhancements

To report bugs raise an Issue in the respective project's repository. When you create a new Issue, a template will be loaded that will guide you through collecting and providing the information we need to investigate.

If you find an Issue that addresses the problem you're having, please add your own reproduction information to the existing issue rather than creating a new one.

### Pull Requests

Pull Requests can be raised to introduce improvements or bug fixes.

* Only fix/add the functionality in question.
* Add unit or integration tests for fixed or changed functionality (if a test suite already exists).
* Address a single concern in the least number of changed lines as possible.
* Include documentation in the repo or on our docs site.

In general, we follow the ["fork-and-pull" Git workflow](https://github.com/susam/gitpr):

1. Fork the repository to your own Github account.
2. Clone the project to your machine.
3. Create a branch locally with a succinct but descriptive name.
4. Commit changes to the branch.
5. Following any formatting and testing guidelines specific to the project.
6. Push changes to your fork.
7. Open a PR in our repository and follow the PR template so that we can efficiently review the changes.
